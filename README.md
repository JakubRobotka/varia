# vue-focus-management

## Description

This library aims to leverage Vue's composition API to provide primitives and widgets for creating Vue components that follow the [WAI ARIA Best practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1).

The main purpose lies in providing unified focus tracking and management as well as proper keyboard navigation and aria attributes where necessary.

This library expectgs that the developer is writing semantic HTML where possible, but also works in situations where that may not be possible.
